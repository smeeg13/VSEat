# VSEat Logbook
To do : 1 logbook explaining how you organized yourself in your project, what problems you encountered and how you solved it. Use day granularity.

<h3>Database</h3>
<p>
First, we agreed on all the tables that we had to integrate into the MCD <br/>
<br/>
Then we have almost separate all the tasks to do : <br/>
- Building the MCD : <b>Mégane</b><br/>
- Adding the cardinalities : <b>Emilie</b> <br/>
- Transforming to MPD and reviewing it : <b>Both</b> <br/>
- Build the script and make sure of the foreign key :<b> Both </b><br/>
</p>
<h3>Business Layer</h3>
<p>
We split the number of classes we had into two and worked on one part each.<br/>
Of course, when we had some problems with a method, we helped each other. <br/>

<br/>
<b>Emilie's Classes :</b> <br/>
- Category<br/>
- Deliverer<br/>
- Location<br/>
- Menu<br/>
<br/>
<b>Mégane's Classes : </b><br/>
- Order<br/>
- OrderDetail<br/>
- Restaurant<br/>
- User<br/>

For each classes we have made a DB class, a IDB class, a Manager class & a IManager class <br/>
<br/>
We did not had a lot of problems with those DB classes but we are a little in trouble with few Manager classes <br/>
