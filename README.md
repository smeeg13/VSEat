# VSEat_WebApp

VSEats is a food delivery application that was made by Mégane Solliard and Emilie Teodoro Do Nascimento. 

## Connect to our Database

Our **Database** is in the Microsoft SQL Server, it uses the IP : **"153.109.124.35"**
The name is **"VS_EAT_Emilie_Megane"**

To login you should use the username **"6231db"** and the password **"Pwd46231."** 

_The path is also stored in the appsettings file of the application._

## Steps to run the application
_the url is 153.109.124.35:81/teodoro_solliard_vseat_

If you want to connect and you're an **Administrator (em.teodoro, 1234)** or a **Deliverer (ETDN, 1234)** you already have your account so you can login with your personal username and password.

And if your a new customer you must create your account by clicking on the "create your account" button on the login page. 
You will be redirected to the create account page where you have to fill the fields to complete your personal informations.

**For informations :**

When creating an account there are some fields which demand specific data 
- For the LocationID : 1 is for Sion. 2 for Savièse, 3 for Conthey, 4 for Sierre and 6 for Martigny.
- For the StatusAccount you must put "Active" and for the IsAdmin you must put "n". 


## Surfing on the site

Based on the account with which you are logged in, you will not have access to all pages of the site.

Then, due to a problem we have encountered, you must first log as an administrator (em.teodoro, 1234), then go back to the previous page with the left arrow and then log with the client account you have just created. 

In case you want to test without creating a new account, you can log as the **client**  : **peter.parker** using his password **1234** by using the method as we notice before.
